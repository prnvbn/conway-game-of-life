# Conway Game of Life
The [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a [Turing Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) invented by [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway).

Each time the simulation is updated, every cell in the grid interacts with its eight neighboring cells in accordance with these four rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two living neighbours dies (isolation).
2. Any cell with two or three living neighbours survives this time (survival).
3. Any cell with more than three living neighbours dies (overpopulation).
4. Any dead cell with three living neighbours comes to life (reproduction).

Conway designed these rules to produce interesting results - even self replicating patterns can be produced. Read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
